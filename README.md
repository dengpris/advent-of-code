# ❄️Advent of Code❄️
Here are my solutions to the yearly holiday coding challenge: Advent of Code🎄! These puzzles are always fun to solve, and I have a huge appreciation to the puzzle writers at AoC.

## 2024
Although this is only my second year (and my first year at seriously attempting AoC), the puzzles feel much easier than 2023. Or maybe...perhaps I improved? I think the former😊

| Day | Difficulty | Comments
|-----|------------|---------
|1    | Easy       | Tuples, hashmap - I finally got to use zip!
|2    | Easy       | Arrays - practicing my list comprehension
|3    | Easy       | RegEx
|4    | Hard       | RegEx, arrays - Not a hard puzzle, but I solved it in a convoluted way
|5    | Medium     | Arrays - I thought I needed to use some fancy tech...but turns out it was just sorting
|6    | Medium     | Bfs - had a minor bug that took a while to debug
| 7   | Easy       | Recursion
| 8   | Medium     | Arrays - The hard part was reading the question
| 9   | Medium     | Strings - Was trickier than expected!
| 10  | Easy       | Bfs
| 11  | Easy       | Recursion
| 12  | Hard       | Arrays - Part 1 was easy, but needed a hint for part 2
| 13  | Medium     | Matrix - I thought it was recursion again but it wasn't 😵
| 14  | Medium     | Arrays - The part 2 was crazy (and I used a hint)
| 15  | Hard       | Arrays - Long, tedious, but rewarding
| 16  | Medium     | Dijkstras
| 17  | Medium/Hard| Class - Needed a hint for part 2
| 18  | Medium     | Bfs - brute forced part 2
| 19  | Easy       | Recursion
| 20  | Medium/Hard| Bfs - Needed a hint for part 2
| 21  | Hard       | Recursion - Needed a hint to memoize properly for part 2
| 22  | Easy       | Class, hashmap - brute force strikes again!
| 23  | Medium     | Hashmap, queue - Fun problem!
| 24  | Hard       | Hashmap - Needed a hint for part 2
